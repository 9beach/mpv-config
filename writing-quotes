If you don't have time to read, you don't have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that. - Stephen King

Indeed, learning to write may be part of learning to read. For all I know, writing comes out of a superior devotion to reading. - Eudora Welty
Read, read, read. Read everything  -  trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You'll absorb it. Then write. If it's good, you'll find out. If it's not, throw it out of the window. - William Faulkner
I kept always two books in my pocket: one to read, one to write in. - Robert Louis Stevenson

If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it. - Toni Morrison
Everybody walks past a thousand story ideas every day. The good writers are the ones who see five or six of them. Most people don’t see any. - Orson Scott

Most writers regard the truth as their most valuable possession, and therefore are most economical in its use. - Mark Twain
When I sit down to write a book, I do not say to myself, ‘I am going to produce a work of art.’ I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing. - George Orwell
Write what disturbs you, what you fear, what you have not been willing to speak about. Be willing to be split open. - Natalie Goldberg

The story must strike a nerve in me. My heart should start pounding when I hear the first line in my head. I start trembling at the risk. - Susan Sontag
Sometimes the ideas just come to me. Other times I have to sweat and almost bleed to make ideas come. It’s a mysterious process, but I hope I never find out exactly how it works. I like a mystery, as you may have noticed. - J.K. Rowling
As for ‘Write what you know,’ I was regularly told this as a beginner. I think it’s a very good rule and have always obeyed it. I write about imaginary countries, alien societies on other planets, dragons, wizards, the Napa Valley in 22002. I know these things. I know them better than anybody else possibly could, so it’s my duty to testify about them. - Ursula K. Le Guin
I’m very lucky in that I don’t understand the world yet. If I understood the world, it would be harder for me to write these books. - Mo Willems

Everywhere I go, I’m asked if the universities stifle writers. My opinion is that they don’t stifle enough of them. - Flannery O’Connor
There are some books that refuse to be written. They stand their ground year after year and will not be persuaded. It isn’t because the book is not there and worth being written - it is only because the right form of the story does not present itself. There is only one right form for a story and, if you fail to find that form, the story will not tell itself. - Mark Twain
Start writing, no matter what. The water does not flow until the faucet is turned on. - Louis L’Amour

Get it down. Take chances. It may be bad, but it's the only way you can do anything really good. - William Faulkner
One thing that helps is to give myself permission to write badly. I tell myself that I’m going to do my five or 10 pages no matter what, and that I can always tear them up the following morning if I want. I’ll have lost nothing - writing and tearing up five pages would leave me no further behind than if I took the day off. - Lawrence Block
Abandon the idea that you are ever going to finish. Lose track of the 400 pages and write just one page for each day, it helps. Then when it gets finished, you are always surprised. - John Steinbeck
You can fix anything but a blank page. - Nora Roberts

There is no real ending. It’s just the place where you stop the story. - Frank Herbert
I would advise any beginning writer to write the first drafts as if no one else will ever read them - without a thought about publication - and only in the last draft to consider how the work will look from the outside. - Anne Tyler
I just give myself permission to suck. I delete about 90 percent of my first drafts, so it doesn’t really matter much if on a particular day I write beautiful and brilliant prose that will stick in the minds of my readers forever, because there’s a 90 percent chance I’m just going to delete whatever I write anyway. I find this hugely liberating. - John Green
Be willing to write really badly. - Jennifer Egan
On first drafts: It is completely raw, the sort of thing I feel free to do with the door shut - it’s the story undressed, standing up in nothing but its socks and undershorts. - Stephen King

You fail only if you stop writing. - Ray Bradbury
If my doctor told me I had only six minutes to live, I wouldn't brood. I'd type a little faster. - Isaac Asimov
Just write every day of your life. Read intensely. Then see what happens. Most of my friends who are put on that diet have very pleasant careers. - Ray Bradbury

I believe myself that a good writer doesn’t really need to be told anything except to keep at it. - Chinua Achebe
The secret to being a writer is that you have to write. It’s not enough to think about writing or to study literature or plan a future life as an author. You really have to lock yourself away, alone, and get to work. - Augusten Burroughs
It is by sitting down to write every morning that one becomes a writer. - Gerald Brenan
Talent is insignificant. I know a lot of talented ruins. Beyond talent lie all the usual words: discipline, love, luck, but most of all, endurance. - James Baldwin

We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down. - Kurt Vonnegut
The nearest I have to a rule is a Post-it on the wall in front of my desk saying ‘Faire et se taire’ from Flaubert. Which I translate for myself as ‘Shut up and get on with it.’ - Helen Simpson
I’ve been writing since I was six. It is a compulsion, so I can’t really say where the desire came from; I’ve always had it. My breakthrough with the first book came through persistence, because a lot of publishers turned it down. - J.K. Rowling
Any man who keeps working is not a failure. He may not be a great writer, but if he applies the old-fashioned virtues of hard, constant labor, he’ll eventually make some kind of career for himself as a writer. - Ray Bradbury
It is worth mentioning, for future reference, that the creative power which bubbles so pleasantly in beginning a new book quiets down after a time, and one goes on more steadily. Doubts creep in. Then one becomes resigned. Determination not to give in, and the sense of an impending shape keep one at it more than anything. - Virginia Woolf
A professional writer is an amateur who didn’t quit. - Richard Bach
You can always edit a bad page. You can’t edit a blank page. ― Jodi Picoult
When your story is ready for a rewrite, cut it to the bone. Get rid of every ounce of excess fat. This is going to hurt; revising a story down to the bare essentials is always a little like murdering children, but it must be done. - Stephen King
The best advice on writing was given to me by my first editor, Michael Korda, of Simon and Schuster, while writing my first book. 'Finish your first draft and then we'll talk,' he said. It took me a long time to realize how good the advice was. Even if you write it wrong, write and finish your first draft. Only then, when you have a flawed whole, do you know what you have to fix. - Dominick Dunne
Editing might be a bloody trade, but knives aren’t the exclusive property of butchers. Surgeons use them too. - Blake Morrison
The main thing I try to do is write as clearly as I can. I rewrite a good deal to make it clear. - E.B. White

Only kings, presidents, editors, and people with tapeworms have the right to use the editorial 'we'. - Mark Twain
So the writer who breeds more words than he needs, is making a chore for the reader who reads. ― Dr. Seuss
Not that the story need be long, but it will take a long while to make it short. - Henry David Thoreau
I would write a book, or a short story, at least three times - once to understand it, the second time to improve the prose, and a third to compel it to say what it still must say. Somewhere I put it this way: first drafts are for learning what one's fiction wants him to say. Revision works with that knowledge to enlarge and enhance an idea, to reform it. Revision is one of the exquisite pleasures of writing. - Bernard Malamud
No author dislikes to be edited as much as he dislikes not to be published. - Russell Lynes
Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book, or for another book; give it, give it all, give it now. - Annie Dillard

A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people. - Thomas Mann
People say, ‘What advice do you have for people who want to be writers?’ I say, they don’t really need advice, they know they want to be writers, and they’re gonna do it. Those people who know that they really want to do this and are cut out for it, they know it. - R.L. Stine
As a writer, you should not judge, you should understand. - Ernest Hemingway
I am irritated by my own writing. I am like a violinist whose ear is true, but whose fingers refuse to reproduce precisely the sound he hears within. - Gustave Flaubert
Let me live, love, and say it well in good sentences. - Sylvia Plath
I go out to my little office, where I’ve got a manuscript, and the last page I was happy with is on top. I read that, and it’s like getting on a taxiway. I’m able to go through and revise it and put myself - click - back into that world. - Stephen King
I think all writing is a disease. You can’t stop it. - William Carlos Williams
Each writer is born with a repertory company in his head. Shakespeare has perhaps 20 players. I have 10 or so, and that’s a lot. As you get older, you become more skillful at casting them. - Gore Vidal
For your born writer, nothing is so healing as the realization that he has come upon the right word. - Catherine Drinker Bowen
The task of a writer consists of being able to make something out of an idea. - Thomas Mann
Some editors are failed writers, but so are most writers. - T.S. Eliot
Many people hear voices when no one is there. Some of them are called mad and are shut up in rooms where they stare at the walls all day. Others are called writers and they do pretty much the same thing. - Margaret Chittenden
A writer never has a vacation. For a writer life consists of either writing or thinking about writing. - Eugene Ionesco
Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing. - Benjamin Franklin

Writers live twice. -  Natalie Goldberg

Anybody can make history. Only a great man can write it. - Oscar Wilde
You must stay drunk on writing so reality cannot destroy you. - Ray Bradbury
Don’t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass. - Anton Chekhov
My own experience is that once a story has been written, one has to cross out the beginning and the end. It is there that we authors do most of our lying. - Anton Chekhov
There are three rules for writing a novel. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are. - Somerset Maugham

The difference between the almost right word and the right word is the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning. - Mark Twain
The main rule of writing is that if you do it with enough assurance and confidence, you’re allowed to do whatever you like. (That may be a rule for life as well as for writing. But it’s definitely true for writing.) So write your story as it needs to be written. Write it ­honestly, and tell it as best you can. I’m not sure that there are any other rules. Not ones that matter. - Neil Gaiman
Exercise the writing muscle every day, even if it is only a letter, notes, a title list, a character sketch, a journal entry. Writers are like dancers, like athletes. Without that exercise, the muscles seize up. - Jane Yolen
Style means the right word. The rest matters little. - Jules Renard
My aim in constructing sentences is to make the sentence utterly easy to understand, writing what I call transparent prose. I’ve failed dreadfully if you have to read a sentence twice to figure out what I meant. - Ken Follett
And one of [the things you learn as you get older] is, you really need less… My model for this is late Beethoven. He moves so strangely and quite suddenly sometimes from place to place in his music, in the late quartets. He knows where he’s going and he just doesn’t want to waste all that time getting there… One is aware of this as one gets older. You can’t waste time. - Ursula K. Le Guin
Part 1. I notice that you use plain, simple language, short words and brief sentences. That is the way to write English - it is the modern way and the best way. Stick to it; don’t let fluff and flowers and verbosity creep in.
You can’t let praise or criticism get to you. It’s a weakness to get caught up in either one. - John Wooden
Rejection slips, or form letters, however tactfully phrased, are lacerations of the soul, if not quite inventions of the devil - but there is no way around them. - Isaac Asimov
Was I bitter? Absolutely. Hurt? You bet your sweet ass I was hurt. Who doesn’t feel a part of their heart break at rejection. You ask yourself every question you can think of, what, why, how come, and then your sadness turns to anger. That’s my favorite part. It drives me, feeds me, and makes one hell of a story. - Jennifer Salaiz
I love my rejection slips. They show me I try. - Sylvia Plath
I would advise anyone who aspires to a writing career that before developing his talent, he would be wise to develop a thick hide. - Harper Lee
I used to save all my rejection slips because I told myself, one day I’m going to autograph these and auction them. And then I lost the box. - James Lee Burke
This manuscript of yours that has just come back from another editor is a precious package. Don’t consider it rejected. Consider that you’ve addressed it ‘to the editor who can appreciate my work’ and it has simply come back stamped ‘Not at this address’. Just keep looking for the right address. - Barbara Kingsolver
To ward off a feeling of failure, she joked that she could wallpaper her bathroom with rejection slips, which she chose not to see as messages to stop, but rather as tickets to the game. - Anita Shreve
Remember: when people tell you something’s wrong or doesn’t work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong. - Neil Gaiman
The artist doesn’t have time to listen to the critics. The ones who want to be writers read the reviews, the ones who want to write don’t have the time to read reviews. - William Faulkner
I think that you have to believe in your destiny; that you will succeed, you will meet a lot of rejection and it is not always a straight path, there will be detours - so enjoy the view. - Michael York
I went for years not finishing anything. Because, of course, when you finish something you can be judged. - Erica Jong
I tell writers to keep reading, reading, reading. Read widely and deeply. And I tell them not to give up even after getting rejection letters. And only write what you love. - Anita Diamant
I could write an entertaining novel about rejection slips, but I fear it would be overly long. - Louise Brown
I had immediate success in the sense that I sold something right off the bat. I thought it was going to be a piece of cake and it really wasn’t. I have drawers full of - or I did have - drawers full of rejection slips. - Fred Saberhagen

The creative process is a process of surrender, not control. - Julia Cameron
An intellectual says a simple thing in a hard way. An artist says a hard thing in a simple way. - Charles Bukowski
When love and skill work together, expect a masterpiece. - John Ruskin
Art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness. It trains the mind through the eye, and the eye through the mind. As the sun colors flowers, so does art color life. - John Lubbock
Personally, I experience the greatest degree of pleasure in having contact with works of art. They furnish me with happy feelings of an intensity that I cannot derive from other sources. - Albert Einstein
